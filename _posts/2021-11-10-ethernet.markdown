Ever wonder if your router is gigabit-capable or not? There is a quick and easy 
way to find out. If you flip over your router and check its LAN ports, you’ll 
see that there are metallic contacts inside them.

In the image below, you’ll see that out of the eight slots available, only four 
of them have metal contacts. The image is that of a 100Mbps capable router and 
the four pins used are the two sets of differential transmit and receive pins 
(Tx+, Tx-, Rx+, Rx-).

The following image shows the same LAN ports but that of a 1Gbps capable router 
and you can see that all eight slots have metallic contacts. Image 3 shows the 
pinout of a RJ45 connector and you can see how the eight pins are used in a 
100Mbps and a 1Gbps connection.

Another method to find out the same is by looking at the underside of the PCB. 
Be aware that if you open the casing, the manufacturer will not honor the device 
warranty. As you can see in image below, there are only four traces (shown by 
the arrows) going from the LAN connector to the processor.

This method of looking at the metal contacts might not always be accurate. 
Sometimes, LAN connectors with eight metal contacts are used in a 100Mbps router. 
However, if you can see that only four metal contacts are present, you can be 
sure that it is a 100Mbps capable router.
