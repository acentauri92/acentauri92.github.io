The Mercator projection or the map that you are used to seeing in school and 
almost all world maps is pretty confusing once you know the kind of manipulations 
that go into making it. All my childhood, I thought that Greenland is almost as 
big as Africa and that Antarctica covers most of the south side of the planet. 
You can see for yourself in the image below showing the map that we are all used
to seeing.

In reality though, the truth is far from it and i only realized that much later 
in life when I saw a documentary on what map projections are. Very recently, a 
book was published by the name “Mapmatics” by Paulina Rowinska, which said that
it explains what these projections are and everything else about maps. I didn’t 
think twice and ordered it. I highly reccomend reading. It was a fascinating 
read and I learnt all kinds of new stuff in it. The book opens by exploring how 
maps are created and how we came about th efamous Mercator projection. Long 
story short, you cannot represent something that is a sphere on a flat piece 
of paper accurately. Some compromises have to be made to do so and that is what 
causes all the confusion regarding the size of continents.

Gerardus Mercator who originally made this map did so by imagining that there is
a lightsource inside the globe at the centre. The globe which would be transparent
and having the continents drawn on it would cast shadows on a paper present nearby. 
The shadows cast on the paper would then create the map that you see above. 
This method causes those enlarged continents.

Now, coming to another confusing part of using this projection is that all maps 
on the internet use it and I am going to show one such example and how it changed 
my view on these inaccurate map. Once while I was flying on a plane from Chicago
to Delhi, I looked out the window and saw what looked like the Northern lights. 
I couldn’t believe it. I always thought that the planes would fly in a straight 
line from one point to another something like what you see in the image below. 
It might sound dumb but a lot of us think that way until we know the truth. I 
would like to thank the education system for making me think that way.

Jokes apart, I had no clue why I was seeing the northern lights when we were 
flying close to the equator. What gave me a clue was the screen on the seat 
ahead that showed the flight path and it did not look like what I had imagined. 
There was no straight line at all.

It showed that we were flying so,ewhere over Greenland that the route looked 
something like the image above. Some research later I found that the aircraft 
fly over Greenland during trans atlantic flights. But why? If you have a globe 
in front of you you could visually see this. Place two pins at the source and 
destination and tie a piece of string connecting the two and pull it tight. The 
path that the string takes on the globe is what the aircraft take more or less. 
You can see for yourself using Google earth if you do not have a globe. We will 
be doing the string experiment virtually using the tool.

I have plotted the route between Atlanta in the USA and Doha in Qatar. You can 
try the same by using the polygon tool in the menubar at the top of the page. 
You then pick the source and destination like before and it will show the path. 
You can see here that the path passes very close to Greenland and northern United 
Kingdom.

To show you that this is the same path that aircraft take, we will be using the 
Flightradar24 website. Once you open the website and zoom out you can see a lot 
of aircraft going across the screen. You can vaguely see that they all seem to 
follow some sort of path. Take a look at the planes flying over the Atlantic 
ocean to see for yourself in the image to the left. The image on the right shows 
the same with the paths turned on and you can see that they follow roughly the 
path that was plotted on Google earth.

</div>

Now, its not always that the planes follow the path. Sometimes, due to issues 
such as restricted airspaces or weather, they take a detour and fly a slightly 
different path. As an example, lets take a plane flying from Boston to Dubai. 
You can see the image in the left below showing the path that it takes and the 
image on the right shows the shortest path between these two cities as shown by 
Google earth. The red lines in the image on the left show the airspace which is 
the portion of the atmosphere that is regulated by a certain authority. The 
plane is clearly avoiding the Syrian airspace and flying around it.

  <img src="/assets/images/mercator/syria-alternate.png" width="49%" alt="Image 2">
</div>


There is a website that you use to see which of the airspaces are safe to fly 
and the image below shows the Syrian airspace to be unsafe for civilian aircraft. 
Now you know why the unexpected deviation in flight path of the planes flying in 
that area.

Sometimes, weather also causes a deviation in path as you can see in the image 
below. The flight from Mumbai to Varnasi takes a detour around a patch of intense 
precipitation.

In the image below, I have plotted out a set of waypoints which are nothing but 
a specific set of coordinates that the aircraft use to navigate. They are kind 
of like landmarks, but imaginary. The red line is the path that we plotted before 
using google maps that sjows the shortest path between two places. You can see 
how those waypoints closely follow the line.
