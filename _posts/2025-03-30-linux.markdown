A while ago, while browsing through the Linux 5.13 source, I came across several 
swear words. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see if any more of these words existed. 
So, using the lovely little grep tool, I searched for some of the words and was 
amazed by how many of these were present. You can see a screenshot below to get 
an idea.

It turns out that there is a fun little webpage that does exactly this – Count 
the number of words matching your input. You can see the count for the word 
‘stupid’ increases with every release. Are developers getting increasingly 
frustrated every year maybe? With the line count of the Linux source approaching 
30 million, I’m not really surprised.

You can also checkout how different companies use their names in the source code. 
Looks like Google is the one that includes its nam ethe most.

Go ahead and check out this webpage. You can type whatever word comes into your 
mind.
