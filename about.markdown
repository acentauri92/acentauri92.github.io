I'm an engineer whose curiosity never quits - always tinkering and exploring 
beyond my day job. I've got a soft spot for astronomy (stargazing never gets old!), 
antenna design (yes, I geek out over signal patterns), and getting my hands 
dirty in the garden.

But if you really want to see me light up, just mention cricket! I'm the kind 
of fan who watches literally every ball bowled in any televised match - men's or 
women's games alike. Total cricket nerd and proud of it! Nothing beats the 
thrill of a tight test match going into the fifth day or a last-over T20 finish.

I can name any constellation in the sky! Whether it's spotting Orion's distinctive 
belt on winter evenings, finding the Southern Cross - I've got them all mapped in 
my head. It all started as a childhood fascination that turned into a proper 
hobby. I've spent countless nights with my telescope and star charts.
